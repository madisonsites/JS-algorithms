# Javascript Algorithms
---

This repo is for you to fork and add your solutions for the JS algorithms that you have completed.

The workflow is as follows:
 1. Fork this repo
 2. Make a new folder for your solution
 3. In that folder create a README.md file where you can explain the problem (it doesn't need to be super fancy, just explain the problem)
 4. Solve the problem!
 5. Add a file with your code in it OR add a photo of your whiteboard solution. You are, of course, welcome to do both.
 6. Push your code
 7. Do a pull request

Good luck!
